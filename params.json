As such, source builds require a connection to\r\nthe Internet, to fetch snapshots, and an OS that can execute the\r\navailable snapshot binaries.\r\n\r\nSnapshot binaries are currently built and tested on several platforms:\r\n\r\n* Windows (7, Server 2008 R2), x86 only\r\n* Linux (various distributions), x86 and x86-64\r\n* OSX 10.6 (\"Snow Leopard\") or greater, x86 and x86-64\r\n\r\nYou may find that other platforms work, but these are our \"tier 1\"\r\nsupported build environments that are most likely to work.\r\n\r\n> ***Note:*** Windows users should read the detailed\r\n> [getting started][wiki-start] notes on the wiki. Even when using\r\n> the binary installer the Windows build requires a MinGW installation,\r\n> the precise details of which are not discussed here.\r\n\r\nTo build from source you will also need the following prerequisite\r\npackages:\r\n\r\n* g++ 4.4 or clang++ 3.x\r\n* python 2.6 or later (but not 3.x)\r\n* perl 5.0 or later\r\n* gnu make 3.81 or later\r\n* curl\r\n\r\nAssuming you're on a relatively modern *nix system and have met the\r\nprerequisites, something along these lines should work.\r\n\r\n    $ curl -O http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.6.tar.gz\r\n    $ tar -xzf rust-0.6.tar.gz\r\n    $ cd rust-0.6\r\n    $ ./configure\r\n    $ make && make install\r\n\r\nYou may need to use `sudo make install` if you do not normally have\r\npermission to modify the destination directory. The install locations\r\ncan be adjusted by passing a `--prefix` argument to\r\n`configure`. Various other options are also supported, pass `--help`\r\nfor more information on them.\r\n\r\nWhen complete, `make install` will place several programs into\r\n`/usr/local/bin`: `rustc`, the Rust compiler; `rustdoc`, the\r\nAPI-documentation tool, and `rustpkg`, the Rust package manager and build system.\r\n\r\n[wiki-start]: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-getting-started-developing-Rust\r\n[tarball]: http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.6.tar.gz\r\n[win-exe]: http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.6-install.exe\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nRust is primarily distributed under the terms of both the MIT license\r\nand the Apache License (Version 2.0), with portions covered by various\r\nBSD-like licenses.\r\n\r\nSee LICENSE-APACHE, LICENSE-MIT, and COPYRIGHT for details.\r\n\r\n## More help\r\n\r\nThe [tutorial] is a good starting point.\r\n\r\n[tutorial]: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
